# Energy Load Forecasting Project

## Overview

This project focuses on forecasting the Energy Load in Brazil using a combination of Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) for time series decomposition and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) neural networks for forecasting. The goal is to provide accurate predictions of energy consumption for better resource planning.
